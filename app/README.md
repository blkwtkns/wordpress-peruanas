# Raices Peruanas portal
Prototype portal for peruvian dance, music, and cultural organization

I first strongly suggest finding a peruvian restaurant, and then learning about the culture. Both the food and culture are very rich with a deep and diverse history.

Project so far is leveraging:
* React { Router, Redux, Bootstrap, Saga } 
* Node, Express, Webpack, Webpack-Isomorphic-Tools, Hot Dev Server 
* AWS Lambda service, and AWS DynamoDB service 

Setting up and isomorphic app is much more of a pain that I realized, so feel free to pick apart and use whatever looks useful. That's what I did. I'm going to post some links below to some repos that really helped me out, and then some other tools that I'm not using now but seem pretty useful and I'll probably test out soon.

The help:
* https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools
I think this repo is worth checking out just to see the beauty of the code. It is very well laid out, with tons of comments, like so many that I got lost sometimes, but no it's very good documentation. And the tool is wonderful. Once you learn to use it.

* https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example
This one is great, and linked from Halt's repo. Has full testing examples and the webpack dev config and package.json are pretty amazing.

* https://github.com/codingbox/isomorphic-react-redux-tutorial
This is a great one too, pretty simple, so it's not going to get you far for taking care of images and css, but it's actually a great boilerplate that you could easily build off of. There's also a 3-part blog series on its creation.

* https://github.com/electrode-io/isomorphic-loader
This one was recommended to me, but I didn't dive in, but it looks very simple. 

* https://github.com/diegohaz/ar://github.com/diegohaz/arc 
I want to use this. It looks so interactive.

### I kept a log (log.md) that give a much too short list of problems I encountered. The biggest one was handling images and css files.
